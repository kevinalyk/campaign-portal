CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (CSP) REMINDER
======================================

Current Status: REPORT-ONLY MODE
This means CSP violations are only being logged to the console, not enforced.

TO SWITCH TO ENFORCEMENT MODE:
------------------------------

1. In next.config.mjs, find all instances of:
   key: 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only'

2. Change them to:
   key: 'Content-Security-Policy'

3. Make sure you've addressed all CSP violations that appeared in your browser console
   during testing. Common domains you might need to add:
   
   - Google services: https://*.googleapis.com https://*.gstatic.com
   - AWS services: https://*.amazonaws.com
   - Analytics: https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googletagmanager.com
   - Any other third-party services your app uses

4. Deploy the changes

5. Test thoroughly to ensure nothing breaks

BENEFITS OF ENFORCEMENT MODE:
----------------------------
- Prevents XSS attacks by restricting which resources can load
- Reduces the impact of any compromised dependencies
- Improves your security posture and compliance

WHEN TO MAKE THIS CHANGE:
------------------------
- After thorough testing in report-only mode
- When you're confident all legitimate resources are allowed
- Before going live with sensitive user data
